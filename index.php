					<a name="about"></a>
					<p>At Karen's Pet Sitting, our care-giving goes well beyond just the physical needs of your animal. We believe that there is a mind-body connection in animals. As such, the emotional state of your pet is just as important as their physical well-being. We aim to reduce occurrences of stress, frustration, loneliness - and yes, even boredom - in the life of your beloved family members.
