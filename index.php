					<h1>About Karen</h1>
					<p>With 25+ years of professional experience of taking care of animals in Suffolk and Nassau County, Karen...</p>
					<p> serve pets of every type, age, and phase of life because we truly love animals. We show it with every belly rub, long walk, scratch behind the ear, and treat we give. We’d love to be your trusted sidekick for a healthy and happy pet because we know we can deliver trusted, quality care and a professional, stress-free experience for you.</p>
					<p>I have taken care of cats, dogs, birds, small animals, fish, farm animals, and all sorts of creatures big and small. Treat pets like they were my own</p>
					<p>At Karen's Pet Sitting, our care-giving goes well beyond just the physical needs of your animal. We believe that, as with humans, there is a mind-body connection in animals. As such, the emotional state of your pet is just as important as his or her physical well-being. To that end, we take great pains to reduce occurrences of stress, frustration, loneliness - and yes, even boredom - in the life of your loved one.
					<p>We always take our cue from you. And so, if an exercise or play regimen is part of your daily routine, we will do our very best to recreate it. By first getting a clear sense of their emotional history from you and, subsequently, through our keen awareness and attention to detail regarding their behavior, the likelihood that your animal will feel safe, comfortable and content in your absence is greatly enhanced.</p>

					<p>Contact Us Today!</p>

					<p>Unlike some other pet sitting services, when I come to your home to take care of your pet(s), I spend all of my time there with your pet(s). I am not reading the paper, watching tv or eating my lunch etc. We are playing, petting, walking or just hanging out.</p>
					<p>For me pet sitting is a lot more than just coming to let your dog out in the yard. I want to connect with your dog or cat and have them really enjoy our time together - whatever that means to them. Whether it be a nice long walk, playing with a favorite toy, just cuddling or a combination of all three, I want your pet to have the best experience possible with me each and every time I come to visit.</p>

					<p>I won't only keep your pets healthy and happy, I'll help keep your home safe while you are away. I will take in your mail and newspaper, water your plants, and alternate the lights that I turn on each night. Naturally, I will alert you immediately if I see anything that looks out of place in your home or requires your immediate attention.</p>
